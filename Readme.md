# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem statement we chose was the First one of the Product Development Track.


Problem Statement 1:
EdTech: In the last 2 years, the field of Education has undergone a massive shift
with the advent of Covid-19. A huge demand has arisen for quality Ed-Tech
products. This system of online education continues to face multiple challenges in
terms of the quality and delivery of education. Design tech-based solutions to help
bridge this gap.

# THE SOLUTION
What we aimed to build was a way to reward all the hardwork that people have went through.

 Through this app people could add different playlist or videos in their library and then could watch all the videos and give a quiz/test based on it and get certified.

Youtube as we all know has become the source of learning for a large group of people. It's a cheaper and better alternative to buying courses.

 People nowadays buy courses just to get certified in the particular domain, so why not get certified for the 60 hours you spent on that youtube playlist.
